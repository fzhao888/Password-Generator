# Password Generator

## Description

The Password Generator website was created to generate a random password based on length and character type criteria user prompts. 

I built this project to understand JavaScripts. I learned how to handle string manipulation, array manipulation, loops,
conditionals, control flow, prompt(), confirm(), alert(), and declaring, defining, and using functions using JavaScript.
